#  Insights
- Bank have got good number of clients from the age base of 25 to 45, especially the age between 35-40. However, if we go forward in age there are some unacceptable results waiting. Clients from the age 50 to 65 has been completly disatisfied from the services that bank offer. More churn in the clients can be found than the one's who is currently present.
- France has done quite a good job compared to other two European countries. Bank's performance in Spain is fairly good. The bank's operation in Germany is little pathetic condition, and requires greater focus on it. Compared to clients who remain in the service about half of the total has left the service. This is an alarming condition in the branches of the bank that operates in Germany.

- Out of all three countries, the banks in Germany is fully evident that more senior citizens quit the service. So, board of the bank must immediately revisit the strategies especially in Germany.

- There is no proper correlation between the age of the clients and the account balance. However, one thing is visible, most of the clients of the age 27 to 44 had very low account balance. Probably, it can be a matter of fact that more the clients are available, the more there are inactive clients.

- As usual in any banks, we can see that clients with very less account balance has left organisation. Especially the one's who were less active was in high number leaving our services. Moreover, there are people with more account balance leaving. This trend must not continue, or else there can be worse future that any banks in the world has not faced.
- On average credit scores of clients, there is no much difference between these countries. However, one can notice that clients in Germany has maintained good credit score compared to other countries.
## Conclusion
In the big picture, the bank's customer churn rate is not excellent. About 20% of the bank's customers recently left, which is a severe issue that needs to be addressed. It is advised on accords to the above insights to revise their strategies in the service offered. Probably, changes might lead to a positive outcome.
